<h2>About me </h2>
<p>My name is Connor Juban and I am a senior at the Louisiana State University.
  I am majoring in Information Systems and Decision Sciences (ISDS) and am passionate about all things information.
  I believe that many of the world's problems can be solved through creative problem-solving with the use of technology. </p>
<p>Personally, one of the things I am most passionate about is data and its applications to solving every-day problems.
  Ever since I was young, the first thing I thought when approaching a task is "how can I make this more efficient?".
  This curiosity and effectiveness has never led me to a problem I couldn't solve.   </p>
